        <h1>Inertia: The Resistance</h1>
        <p>Inertia was created originally to be a comic book. However, as time progressed, I realized I wanted to do more than the limitations of a comic. Thus, I began to create Inertia as a visual novel.</p>
        <p>In Inertia you can choose between two different characters.
        <ul>
            <li>Ian <img src="Images/Ian.png" height=200 alt="One of the main characters in Inertia">
            </li>
            <li>Rikku <img src="Images/Rikku.png" height=200 alt="One of the main characters in Inertia">
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Inertia was intended for you to choose your own story. Yes, that means not only can you choose your character but you get to see different story lines based on the decisions you choose!</p>
        <p>Make sure you play both characters stories because you'll find something new every single playthrough!</p>
